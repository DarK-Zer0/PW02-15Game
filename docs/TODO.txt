Things to do:

[Nathnael]
- Add Shuffle functionality (based on requirements)
  - Cells must be rearranged in a solvable state
  - Shuffle cells by moving them randomly to the empty cell a certain number of times
  - A function for randomly selecting a neighboring cell to the empty cell may be required
[Indra]
- Add win condition
  - Check for win after a cell swap
  - May have to add a global variable that deactivates the win condition when shuffling
[Zian]
- Add a timer and music
  - Timer from HW may prove useful
